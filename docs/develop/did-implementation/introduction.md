## DID
A DID is essentially a unique identifier, that has een created without the presence of a central athuority.  DID in context of Verifiable Credentials is used to sign documents, thereby facilitating the user to prove ownership of the document when required.

The Polygon DID method definition conforms to the DID-Core specifications and standards. A DID uri is composed of three components separated by colons, the scheme, followed by the method name and finally a method specific identifier. For Polygon the uri looks like
```

```
Here the scheme is ‘did’, method name is ‘polygon’ and method specific identifier is an ethereum address.
